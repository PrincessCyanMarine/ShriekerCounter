## This mod adds a HUD element that counts how many sculk shriekers were activated by the player

# Sides
Required server side (I wanted to make it client side only, but didn't find a way to read shrieker warnings without the server)

Technically optional on client

# Customization
### Commands
### Config

# Other stuff
This mod requires [completeconfig](https://beta.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/completeconfig) and [YetAnotherConfigLib](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/yacl) is recommended. Both are already included in the main file download

The "pure" file doesn't include either and therefore requires them to be installed normally
